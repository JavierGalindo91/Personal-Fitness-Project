# Personal Fitness Project
A chance to better my health by introducing good habits.

I decided to invest more time to improving my overall fitness. I have not been able to keep a consistent diet and exercise/resting schedule despite being an athlete growing up.

### **The purpose of this project is take an analytical approach to my fitness in order to achieve my goal of reaching 190lbs.**

# My Journey So Far
I grew up playing soccer. I love the sport and I cannot play it because I'm too fat and I have bad knees. Also, life got busier and I lost interest in doing the things that kept me in good health.

It's all my fault. I got lazy and it took a toll on my weight. This made it difficult to enjoy sports, as I often got injured and hardly made a full recovery. 

### **_Bad habits like eating poorly and not resting enough can develop terrible health issues as we age._**

It is our responsability to take care of our mind and body as much as we can.

# DATA SOURCES and TOOLS
A database will be created in a local MS SQL SERVER which will feed the data model in Power BI. 

The final deliverable will be a dashboard that tracks the following components:
- **_Weight Tracker_**: Log that tracks changes for weight, waist, hips and neck measurements in inches. This data also tracks Body Fat % and changes in Fat Mass and Lean Mass in lbs.
- **_Workout Journal_**: Records details from each movement performed during a workout session.
- **_HR Monitor Log_**: Keeps a record of Heart Rate readings for each workout/physical activity. The device I'm using to record this data is the Garmin Forerunner 235.
- **_Food Log_**: Collects data for individual food entries. I am using the MyFitnessPal application for this step.

Here is a picture of the data model:
