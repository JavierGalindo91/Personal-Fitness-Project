# Monthly Health & Performance Review

This repository documents a **monthly, data-driven review of health and training performance** using nutrition, exercise, body composition, and heart-rate data.

Every 30 days, a **slide deck is published** summarizing:
- Diet execution (calories, macros, protein consistency)
- Training frequency, volume, and structure
- Heart-rate–based workload and efficiency metrics (e.g., Session Load Index, training density)
- Body composition trends (weight, waist, fat mass, lean mass)
- Clear, quantified action items for the next cycle

The focus is on **execution quality, efficiency, and repeatable decision-making**, not motivation or anecdotes.
