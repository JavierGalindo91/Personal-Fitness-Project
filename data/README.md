# Data Set Specifications

The purpose of this file is to provide details of the data collection process. All log files are saved in CSV format. 

## DATA SOURCES
At this moment, data is captured from four different sources:
- **_Weight Tracker_**: Tracks progress in weight and body composition over time.
- **_Food Log_**: Logs details for each entry like macros and other components like sodium intake and cholesterol.
- **_Workout Journal_**: Records number of repetitions for each movement performed during a workout session.
- **_HR Monitor Log_**: Heart Rate readings for each workout/physical activity.

## WEIGHT TRACKER
Each row represents a dated measurement, recording key anthropometric metrics and calculating derived values using the U.S. Navy Body Fat formula, which adjusts based on gender.
